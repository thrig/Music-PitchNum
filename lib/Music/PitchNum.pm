=head1 NAME

Music::PitchNum - note name and pitch number utility roles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyCleverModule;
  use Moo;
  with('Music::PitchNum');
  ...

Then elsewhere:

  use MyCleverModule;
  my $x = MyCleverModule->new;

  $x->pitchname(69);    # A4
  $x->pitchnum('A4');   # 69

See also the C<eg/> and C<t/> directories of the distribution of this module
for example code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

"One need but glance at the various notations for a single tone to be convinced that there is a sorrowful lack of agreement in usage." -- R. W. Young. "Terminology for Logarithmic Frequency Units"

=back

This module provides utility music pitch name and number routines; that is, an
easy way to obtain pitch numbers from various pitch name formats (Helmholtz, or
in particular what C<lilypond> uses, what L<MIDI::Simple> accepts, and the
American Standard Pitch Notation (ASPN)). The resulting pitch numbers are
integers (as used by the MIDI standard), though this module does not restrict
the range of the pitch numbers as MIDI does (support for black hole pressure
waves was a design goal).

This module is somewhat catholic in what it accepts; alternatives are the
variety of sub-modules that support only the named notation system; the
L<Music::PitchNum::German> implementation, in particular, is Helmholtz-based,
though with "H" representing B natural and "B" as B flat as is necessary for
BACH motif support. Not supported by this particular module include the ABC
notation, solfege note names, and various other International formats. There is
also no microtonal support, and the traditional Western 12-tone chromatic scale
is used as the basis for the resulting pitch numbers. Also, the parsing of the
notes is limited to just the note name, octave indication, and accidental, and
in no way supports rhythmic elements or the like.

This module is expected to be used as a Role from some other module;
L<Moo::Role> may be informative.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<pitchname> I<pitchnumber>

Returns a pitch name for the pitch number provided in the ASPN format. Will
C<die> if passed something that does not look like a number.

  ->pitchname(59);       # B3
  ->pitchname(60);       # C4
  ->pitchname(61);       # C#4

=item B<pitchnum> I<pitchname>

Returns the pitch number for the given pitch, or C<undef> if nothing was parsed
from the input. Anything that already looks like a number will be returned by
way of a trip through the C<int> function.

  ->pitchnum(q{D4b});    # 61
  ->pitchnum(q{Db4});    # 61
  ->pitchnum(q{cis'});   # 61
  ->pitchnum(q{bisis});  # 61

The accidentals supported are quite varied, and may be doubled to produce the
corresponding doubleflat or doublesharp. The allowed list includes the flats
C<b>, C<es>, C<ess>, C<f>, or C<flat> or the sharps C<s>, C<is>, C<iss>,
C<sharp>, C<#>, C<d>, or C<k>. These can be mixed with the note names A through
G, and either the ASPN octave number (4 for middle C) or the Helmholtz-derived
C<,> or C<'> indicators as used in C<lilypond>.

English multiple C notation is supported with upper case note names for the
octaves below the C below middle C:

  ->pitchnum('C');       # 48
  ->pitchnum('CC');      # 36
  ->pitchnum('CCC');     # 24

In general, the first matching element wins, so if something silly like
C<CCC''4> were specified, the English match happens first (as that occurs while
matching the note name) and then the other octave indicators are ignored. Other
implementations may desire a tighter match or to throw errors on such
absurdities.

=head1 BUGS

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-music-pitchnum at rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Music-PitchNum>.

Patches might best be applied towards:

L<https://github.com/thrig/Music-PitchNum>

=head2 Known Issues

Matching the fancy flat symbol (or the double-flat, or double-sharp) is not yet
supported. Use C<##> or C<b> or C<bb> for those in the meantime, or the various
other ASCII forms allowed. Doubtless other things besides.

=head1 SEE ALSO

How the resulting pitch names or numbers are used is of no concern to this
module, though see L<MIDI::Simple> or L<Music::Scala> or L<Music::LilyPondUtil>
for means to convert the numbers into MIDI events, frequencies, or a form
suitable to pass to lilypond.

L<Moo> and L<Moo::Role> would be good reads for programmers using this module.
